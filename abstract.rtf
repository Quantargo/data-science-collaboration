\f0\fs36 \cf0 Let\'92s play together: Collaborative Data Science\
\
From experience we have learned that most data science projects are not truly collaborative efforts but only driven by a few key players. Best (public) examples are most open source R and Python packages available on Github. However, collaboration of data science teams can be *the* determining factor driving innovation in a sustainable way. This talk highlights some common problems in data science projects and gives guidance how collaboration can be improved to facilitate a data-driven transformation in organisations.}
